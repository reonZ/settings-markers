# FoundryVTT Settings Markers

This module adds ðŸŒŽ and ðŸ‘¤ markers to the settings window to help differentiate which ones are `client` or `world` settings.

It was created to replace the module `DF Settings Clarity` which has not been maintained since before the `v9` of the FoundryVTT.

The icons were directly taken from `DF Settings Clarity` ; The original module can be found [here](https://github.com/flamewave000/dragonflagon-fvtt/tree/master/df-settings-clarity).
